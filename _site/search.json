Visible signs of infection include deformation of the beak, claws and feathers. Sightings can be logged here, and if you’d like more information about this project, please get in contact at MankyParrot@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeathers\r\nfeathers is an R package that contains colour palettes inspired by the plumage of Australian birds. For species exhibiting sexual dimorphism (i.e. males and females look different), I have used female colours. Research on birds has historically been biased towards males, and the choice to use female colours in this package is my way of highlighting the often-overlooked beauty of female birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrtistry\r\nSometimes I make art in R, and sometimes I post it on Twitter with the #rtistry tag. If you’re interested in the code behind the images, you can find it on GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30DayMapChallenge\r\nThe #30DayMapChallenge was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in November 2019. My contributions to the 2021 challenge are here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
