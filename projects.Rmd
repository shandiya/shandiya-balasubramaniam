Manky Parrots is a citizen science project that aims to map the incidence of 
psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) in Australia. Collecting records of 
the locations and movements of infected birds is a step towards understanding 
the spread of this disease in the wild. Visible signs of infection include 
deformation of the beak, claws and feathers. Sightings can be logged 
[here](https://tinyurl.com/MankyParrots), and if you'd like more information 
about this project, please get in contact at MankyParrot@gmail.com.

`feathers` is an R package that contains colour palettes inspired by the plumage of Australian birds. For species exhibiting sexual dimorphism (i.e. males and females look different), I have used female colours. Research on birds has historically been biased towards males, and the choice to use female colours in this package is my way of highlighting the often-overlooked beauty of female birds.

Sometimes I make art in R. These are often posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShandiyaB) and tagged `#rtistry`. If you're interested in the code that creates these images, it can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/shandiya) in a few different repositories.
